# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?
I hope to have a better understanding of Python and to be able to make my own projects.
What about 6 months from now?
I'd either be in college and working a job or just working a job.
or 1 year from now?
I hope to be on my way or about to move out and finding a long-term job
Are you excited? Scared? Eager?
I'm mostly nervous about getting confused about some topics but I'm excited to learn more so I can do more, especially with Python
What do you hope to accomplish?
I hope to be able to make something and build a portfolio so I can get a job and get better as I progress
Can you foresee potential roadblocks?
A future roadblock might be working through concepts I get stuck on
What can be done to prevent or circumvent them?
It would be easier to get through confusing topics as I can go back and look through class recordings and the readings
Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success?
Keep posting resources and readings like the Git 101
